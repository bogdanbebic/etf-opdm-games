# etf-opdm-games
Collection of simple discrete math games created for a school assignment.

Each game is organized to it's own folder, with a global `index.html` file
in the root of the repo which links to the home page for each game.

The games are meant to be executed on the client side in a browser.
The intention is to have all of these easily accessible to everyone, without any cost to the maintainers.
These games are deployed in the GitHub pages associated to this repo and freely accessible.
